### ☪️ Ayah of the Day

<!-- AYAHADAY:START -->
<sub>_The Cave_</sub><br>
**Surah Al-Kahf** (18: 18)

> And you would have thought they were awake, though they were asleep. We turned them over, to the right and left, while their dog stretched his forelegs at the entrance. Had you looked at them, you would have certainly fled away from them, filled with horror.

— Sha'ban 20, 1447H
